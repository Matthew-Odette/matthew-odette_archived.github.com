title: Day 3 - Zero to MVP in 30 Days - Product Hunt's Ship and Communities
---

<div class="intro">
  Hey there!

  I'll be writing two posts tomorrow. In addition to the daily update, I’ll write up how I set up a slack channel to have a free feed of targeted content to prospect from and engage in. It pulls in updates from Reddit, Quora, Hacker News, Stackoverflow, and a handful of Google alerts. 
</div>

This stream of content lets me jump into discussions to help build an early audience. And this helps prevent me from distracting myself on a bunch of tabs searching for new content!

----------------------------------------------------------

## Product Hunt’s Ship

I did pull the trigger on Product Hunt’s Ship. It’s not published yet, but you all can access it before I publish it if you like! https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/bystander-io

I’m holding off on promoting it because I’m far enough into scaffolding my app that I’ll be able to mock up some static screenshots for a landing page tomorrow. After looking at some of the more successful Ships, they all have landing pages available rather than using ship a tool to solve being at a pre-landing page stage.

I also pasted their widget [on my personal website](http://matthewodette.com/day-2-zero-to-mvp-in-30-days-copy) in case you’d like a look at how their embedded option looks.

-------------------------------------------------------------

## More validation efforts!

And finally, I continued to message folks for validation in the two channels [I was exploring yesterday](http://matthewodette.com/day-2-zero-to-mvp-in-30-days).

But I also added on communities. An example of this is available on [/r/userexperience](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/). With communities jumping in with self promotion is definitely a no-no. **I always message the community moderators before posting anything related to validating and idea**. This is so crucial, as long as you explain the purpose of your post and make it within their guidelines, they’re usually happy to let you kick off a discussion!

As an example to work from, here’s the message I send to the mods of /r/userexperience:

>Hey r/ux mod team!
>
>I was wondering if a post asking the r/ux community about validating an idea would be within the subreddits rules?
>
>I don't want to share any external links or promotion. For context: I just started a "30 days to MVP" challenge, and I would love to have a discussion with the folks here just about ideas/needs.
>
>A bit about the idea I'm looking at and my background, just in case that helps: I'm coming from a senior/lead support engineering position. In this role over the last few years I've seen a lot of pain coming from the visual user error experience (toasts, alerts, etc.) A trend is that errors get pushed for new features, and generally those error messages are abandoned until there's a tipping point of friction from github issues and customers writing in needing a repeatable workaround.
>
>I'm curious what folks strategy from different backgrounds are on tracking the user-visible error experience, and how they measure & iterate to make improvements.
>
>Would asking about the above fit in ok? If not that's totalllyyy fine! And thank you for reading :-) And I apologize for this running a bit long!

And with a positive response from that I fired off my post to the subreddit. Although this particular post, at the time I’m writing this, doesn’t have any replies yet. But it’s only a few hours old, and posts there do take a bit of time to get traction. **Even if it dies off with zero responses, I would not have known that without trying!** 

Just do stuff, we need to find what works.

I’ve reached a few communities today, but tomorrow I’ll expand to Facebook groups and even give LinkedIn groups a shot.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Day 4 on deck

-  First iteration of a landing page on Bystander.io
-  Publish/promote the Ship page
-  More validation outreach
-  Publish an article on curating a list of content to a slack channel that you can use to engage your audience
-  Switching to some dev work when I need a change of pace, but I expect tomorrow will be light on the development side

Onwards!
