title: Day 17 - Zero to MVP in 30 Days - Prepping for our calls
---

<div class="intro">
  Hey all!

  If you’re new to this series, I laid down some ground rules <a href="https://hackernoon.com/day-0-zero-to-mvp-in-30-days-31c83db6aadf">in day zero</a>, and explain the idea for my first project <a href="https://hackernoon.com/day-1-zero-to-mvp-in-30-days-idea-number-1-18536868e282">on day one</a>. I document, a little every day, what I’m working on.

I continued our big push of cold emailing as expected. We’re still looking to get around 30 total calls scheduled. 

Tomorrow we start on our first market research calls, which I took some time to prepare for today. I don’t have a script or anything that strict laid out, but I do have a list of questions lined up to keep the conversation going around uncovering challenges and try to talk about what a perfect solution would look like.

Here’s a list of some resources I’ve used to lend a guiding hand with preparing a list of interview questions:

* [How do you validate your startup idea with customers?](https://grasshopperherder.com/how-do-you-validate-your-startup-idea-with-customers/)
* [How to Interview your Customers](http://customerdevlabs.com/2013/11/05/how-i-interview-customers/)
* [Product Managers: 12 Great Customer Interview Questions](https://www.productplan.com/product-managers-12-great-customer-interview-questions/)
* [Five Whys](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/five-whys.html)

## Tomorrow

* More emailing, of course!
* Fumble through our first few market research interviews, this should be quite a learning experience!
