title: Day 16 - Zero to MVP in 30 Days - Getting Ready for Monday
---

<div class="intro">
  Hiya!

  If you’re new to this series, I laid down some ground rules <a href="https://hackernoon.com/day-0-zero-to-mvp-in-30-days-31c83db6aadf">in day zero</a>, and explain the idea for my first project <a href="https://hackernoon.com/day-1-zero-to-mvp-in-30-days-idea-number-1-18536868e282">on day one</a>. I document, a little every day, what I’m working on.

More of the same today! I mentioned yesterday that we’d have a few short updates over the next bit. Today was a big push on going farther down the SaaS1000 list to get as many calls lined up as we can.

I’m looking forward to seeing what we learn this week with our market research!

## Tomorrow’s todo list

* A big list of follow ups go out, and an equally large list of new cold outreach. Let’s validate or pivot to validation!

I hope you all had an amazing weekend!
