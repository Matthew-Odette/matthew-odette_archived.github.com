title: Day 4 - Zero to MVP in 30 Days - Landing page delays

<div class="intro">
  Hey all!

  A quickie tonight. Producing static screenshots that I’m satisfied with for my initial landing page is taking longer than I had anticipated (as these things go!)

But, taking some stock from a bit of research yesterday during lunch, I decided to iframe my Product Hunt Ship page [on bystander.io](http://bystander.io/) until I do put up a landing page. Likely Thursday as tomorrow is a bit thin.

After looking at every ship page with over 1000 subscribers, at least one just iframed their Ship page on their homepage, which is where the idea came from. Here’s a peek at that breakdown:

I’m happy to share the spreadsheet and go over some findings on successful Ship pages if there’s interest.
